Design a network monitoring system that provides real-time monitoring and management of network devices and traffic within a corporate network.

Requirements:

Use Case Diagram:

Identify and describe primary actors (e.g., Administrator, Network Device, Monitoring System).
Define use cases such as Monitor Network Traffic, Manage Network Devices, Generate Reports, etc.
Include relationships between actors and use cases.
Class Diagram:

Model key classes and their relationships within the monitoring system.
Consider classes like NetworkDevice, TrafficMonitor, ReportGenerator, AlertSystem, etc.
Specify attributes and methods for each class.
Sequence Diagram:

Illustrate the flow of interactions when monitoring network traffic.
Show sequences of messages exchanged between components (e.g., Administrator, TrafficMonitor, NetworkDevice).
Focus on specific scenarios like detecting anomalies in network traffic or adding new devices to monitoring.
State Diagram:

Model states and state transitions for a NetworkDevice (e.g., Online, Offline, Maintenance).
Define events triggering state changes (e.g., Device Turned On, Device Disconnected).
Include actions taken in response to state changes (e.g., Send Alert, Update Monitoring Dashboard).
Component Diagram:

Identify and depict high-level components of the monitoring system (e.g., Database, User Interface, Network Devices).
Show dependencies and interfaces between components.
Include deployment nodes if extending the diagram to deployment perspective (optional).
Deliverables:

UML diagrams (Use Case, Class, Sequence, State, Component) in a format suitable for presentation (e.g., PDF, images).
A brief description (1-2 pages) explaining each diagram, its purpose, and how it contributes to the overall design of the network monitoring system.
Optional: A brief narrative or storyboard illustrating a typical scenario of system usage based on the diagrams.
Guidelines:

Ensure diagrams are clear, well-labeled, and adhere to UML standards.
Use appropriate symbols, notations, and relationships to accurately represent the system architecture and behavior.
Consider scalability, maintainability, and performance aspects in your design.
