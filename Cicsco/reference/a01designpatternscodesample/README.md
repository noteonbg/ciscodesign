Design patterns 

1. Factory
To separate the responsbility of object creation from it's user
2. Singleton
To limit the number of instances of a class to a maximum of one
3. Prototype
To quickly create multiple objects of a class with similar initial state
4. Builder
To assemble a complex object, one step at a time
5. Adapter
To provide a known interface to an unknown object
6. Decorator
To extend an object
7. Proxy
To do pre and post processing anonymously
8. Composite
To treat sum of parts as a whole
9. Mediator
To enable intra-group communication, asynchronously
10. Chain of responsibility
To escalate conditionally, in a hierarchy
11. State
To build a state machine
12. Template
To create generaic algorithms
13. Visitor
To decorate multiple objects in a graph
14. Observer
To enable inter-group communication, asynchronously
15. Strategy
To select algorithm at run-time
16. Abstract Factory
To choose one from multiple factories for same interface
